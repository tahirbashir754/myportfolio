Run Commands:-

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the project repository from GitHub or any other version control system to your local machine.

2. **Setup Virtual Environment (Optional)**: It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project to manage dependencies separately. You can use `venv` or `virtualenv` to create a virtual environment.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using pip. You can find the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Database Setup**: Configure your database settings in the `settings.py` file. Then, create the database tables by running the following commands:

   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a Superuser (Optional)**: If your project includes authentication, you can create a superuser to access the Django admin panel.

   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the Development Server**: Start the Django development server.

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access the Website**: Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access your Django website.

8. **Access the Django Admin Panel (Optional)**: If you created a superuser, you can access the admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` to manage the site's content.

Remember, these commands are generic, and your specific project may have additional configurations or requirements. Always refer to the project's documentation or README for any project-specific instructions.
